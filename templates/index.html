							<!---1 of 2--->
							<p class="text1">
								As of March 2020, starting from the 1978 Air India Flight 855 incident up to the 2018 Algerian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76 incident, 
								there have been 33 aviation incidents in which 200 or more people died. The largest loss of life on board a single-aircraft is the
								520 fatalities in the 1985 Japan Airlines Flight 123 incident, the largest loss of life in multiple aircraft in a single incident 
								is the 583 fatalities in the two airplanes that collided in the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster, while the largest loss of life 
								overall in a collective incident is the 2,996 fatalities in the coordinated terrorist destruction of airplanes and occupied 
								buildings in the 2001 September 11 attacks.  <br>
								<br>
								The deadliest aviation-related disaster of any kind, considering fatalities on both the aircraft and the ground, was the 
								destruction of the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001. On that morning, four commercial aircraft 
								traveling on transcontinental flights from East Coast airports to California were hijacked after takeoff. The four hijacked 
								aircraft were subsequently crashed in four separate suicide attacks against major American landmarks, by 19 Islamic terrorists 
								affiliated with Al Qaeda. American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the 
								North and South Towers respectively of the World Trade Center, destroying both buildings in less than two hours. <br>
								<br>
								The World Trade Center crashes killed 2,753, the vast majority of fatalities being occupants of the World Trade Center towers
								or emergency personnel responding to the disaster. In addition, 184 were killed by American Airlines Flight 77, which 
								crashed into The Pentagon (causing severe damage and partial destruction to the building's west side). 40 passengers
								were also killed when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a Somerset County, Pennsylvania field after passengers 
								fought back and prevented the hijackers from reaching their designated target. This brought the total number of 
								casualties of the September 11 attacks to 2,996 (including the 19 terrorist hijackers). As deliberate terrorist acts, 
								the 9/11 crashes were not classified as accidents, but as mass murder-suicide; these events were subsequently treated 
								by the United States and the member nations of NATO as an act of war and terrorism.<br><br>

									Air travel is the fastest method of transport around, and can cut hours or days off of a trip. Transoceanic travel would be a factor of months without planes, and numerous rural zones can't be reached without it. As the WV Department of Aviation says, "One to two days travel by auto can be accomplished in one to two hours of flight.".
